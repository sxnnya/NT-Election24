UNC Charlotte Election 2024 Perspectives (Niner Times)

## About
This project examines the responses of 90 UNC Charlotte students regarding the 2024 Election. The results were published in the Niner Times (UNC Charlotte's student newspaper) online, in the print Voter Guide, and on social media. I also made all visualizations on the article, print, and social media.

## Data Source
This project uses data from a survey I created, which the Niner Times disseminated. The survey was shared with the student body on Instagram, YikYak, Snapchat, and Reddit. 95 people filled out the survey, and five entries were removed only to keep results focused on students. While there are 90 student responses, this is a low number and cannot be used to represent the entire campus student population.
